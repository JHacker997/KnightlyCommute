We would like to do a representation of Shortest path calculation using Dijkstra's algorithm. 
Our idea was to have the algorithm work on a map representing UCF and the nearby surrounding areas and calculate the shortest path from a given intersection to another. 
The weights of each edge would be scalars representing the amount of traffic on any given road, and the algorithm would be shown taking each road, and backtracking if its not on the shortest path. 
All these changes would be represented on the map until the shortest path is found and represented on the map.
